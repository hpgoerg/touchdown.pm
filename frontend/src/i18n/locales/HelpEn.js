    GENERAL: `
**Touchdown.pm** is a lean - easy to use - project management software, _loosely_ oriented to the __scrum__ method.
`,


    EPIC: `
An **Epic** is an aggregation of userstories.  
You can use an epic in the sense of a _project_ or an _initiative_ or an
all in all description of a desired business functionality or a software.

The same userstory can be assigned to _multiple_ epics. The idea behind this is to define an epic whose functionality
is in part already implemented. This allows reuse.
`,


    IMPEDIMENT: `
In _Touchdown.PM_ an **Impediment** is anything that slows velocity of the teams and hinders them to get their work done.  
In _Touchdown.PM _impediments are defined independent of sprints or epics to realize general problems early.`,

    LOGIN: `
**Login** with your **Email Address** and your **Password**.
`,

    MEMBER: `
The view to edit **Members** can only be used by members with role **Administrator**.  

In addition to edit members with the online view members can be imported in the backend.   
See **README.md** in the backend.
`,

    RELEASE: `
A **Release** is the rollout of a software (or of software components) or of a product in general.  

In the sense of Scrum software rollout should be iterative in relative short periods. 
`,

    SPRINT: `
Oriented to _Scrum_ a **Sprint** is understood as a time-boxed period to develop a potentially
releasable software component or generally a product part.  

A specific characteristic in *Touchdown.PM* is that a *Task* is not understood as part of _one_ userstory, but as a helper
construct to define the work to be done in a Sprint.  

The assumption is that one sprint task may eventually be relevant
for more than one userstory and that some tasks are general tasks (e.g. documentation).
`,

    USERSTORY: `
A **Userstory** in _Touchdown.PM_ describes a business functionality from the perspective of a role actor like in _scrum_.  
_Touchdown.PM_ has **no** explicit **backlog**, but you can use the **Workflow status** of a userstory in the sense of a
backlog filter.
